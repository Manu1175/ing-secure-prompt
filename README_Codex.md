> You are a senior Python engineer working on **SecurePrompt**.  
> **Goal (Week-1):** Deliver MVP-3 by Thu 02 Oct 2025: CLI+FastAPI scrubbing for prompts, pdf, png; explanations; C-level controls; append-only audit; role-gated de-scrub. On Fri 03 Oct present precision/recall on the golden set and a live demo.  
> **Rules:** Modify only `/secureprompt` and `/api` (and `/tools` for ingestion). Each function has tests & docstrings. Never log raw sensitive text; use identifiers. After each change: run `make test-fast` and update `/reports/metrics.md`.  
> **Data:** Put your external folders into `external/SecurePrompt/DATA` and `external/SecurePrompt/PROMPTS`. Run `make ingest-secureprompt` to build `data/golden/*.jsonl`, `data/eval/*.jsonl`, and `/policy/manifests/*.yml`. Tests must read normalized JSONL, not raw spreadsheets.  
> **Day-1 tasks:** Scaffold CLI, detectors (IBAN/PAN/email/phone/name), hash-chained audit, ingestion tool, and unit tests.
